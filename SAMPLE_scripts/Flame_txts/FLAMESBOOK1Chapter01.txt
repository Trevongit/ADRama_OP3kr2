A Spark in the Dark, Chapter 1


Lira climbed the creaky attic stairs, dust motes dancing in the slanted light that spilled through a single, grimy window. The air smelled of old paper and forgotten memories, a scent that clung to her like a shadow. It had been a year since her grandmother passed, but the attic still felt like Gran’s domain—boxes of faded photographs, stacks of yellowed journals, and that rickety chair where Gran used to spin tales of stars and hidden truths. Lira’s chest tightened. She wasn’t sure why she’d come up here today, only that the silence of their cramped Lumora apartment had grown too loud to bear.


The city hummed beyond the window, a restless pulse of neon signs and distant traffic. Lumora was a sprawling mess of steel and screens, where people lived half their lives in virtual feeds, scrolling through endless noise. At sixteen, Lira felt like an outsider even in her own home. School was a battlefield of cliques and cutting remarks, and her parents—both buried in their jobs at the city’s tech hubs—barely noticed her quiet struggles. Gran had been her anchor, her storyteller, filling Lira’s mind with wonders the city seemed to have forgotten. Now, with Gran gone, Lira carried those stories alone, like embers she couldn’t quite keep burning.


She knelt beside a cardboard box labeled “Keepsakes” in Gran’s shaky handwriting. Inside, she found a tangle of trinkets—a tarnished locket, a dried flower pressed between pages, a cracked music box that no longer played. Her fingers brushed something smooth and cool, hidden beneath the clutter. She pulled it free: a sleek, dark device, no bigger than a notebook, its surface unmarred by the scratches or wear of age. It looked like a tablet, but older, its edges rounded in a style Lira didn’t recognize. The screen was blank, a deep, velvety black, and it felt warm to the touch, as if it had been waiting.


“What are you?” she murmured, turning it over. There were no buttons, no ports, just a faint seam where the screen met the frame. She traced it with her thumb, and the device hummed softly, a vibration that tingled up her arm. The screen flickered, then flared with a single point of light—brilliant, white, like a newborn star caught in glass. Lira gasped, nearly dropping it. The spark pulsed, slow and steady, casting a soft glow across her hands and face. Her reflection stared back, wide-eyed and uncertain, framed by the attic’s shadows.


She sat back on her heels, clutching the device. The light seemed alive, responding to her breath, her heartbeat. She thought of Gran’s stories—tales of a time when people looked to the stars for answers, not screens—and a question bubbled up unbidden: *Why did the stars matter to you, Gran?* The spark flared brighter, tendrils of light curling outward like tiny flames. Lira’s pulse quickened. Was it imagining things, or had the device heard her?


For a moment, she hesitated. Lumora was a city of tech, where devices like this were everywhere—smartphones, AR glasses, neural implants—but this felt different. Older. Secret. She glanced at the window, where faint stars winked through the city’s haze. Gran had always said the stars held stories, if you knew how to listen. Lira closed her eyes, focusing on the warmth in her hands, and hummed the lullaby Gran used to sing—a soft, lilting tune about a girl who followed a star home. The spark responded, its light swelling, wrapping her in a cocoon of gentle radiance. Her loneliness eased, just for a moment, replaced by a flicker of awe.


“Lira? You up there?” Her mother’s voice cut through the attic’s stillness, sharp with impatience. Lira jolted, the light dimming as her focus broke. She shoved the device under her sweater, its warmth pressing against her skin, and scrambled to her feet.


“Yeah, just… looking for something,” she called back, her voice unsteady. Footsteps echoed on the stairs, and her mother appeared, a silhouette against the dim light below. She was a tall woman, her face etched with the exhaustion of long hours at the data firm, her dark hair pulled into a tight bun.


“What are you digging through now?” her mother asked, eyeing the scattered boxes. “You should be studying. Exams are next month.”


“I know,” Lira muttered, kicking a journal back into the box. “I just… wanted to feel close to Gran.”


Her mother’s expression softened, but only briefly. “I miss her too, but dwelling won’t help. Come down and finish your homework.” She turned, her footsteps retreating, leaving Lira alone with the weight of unspoken words.


Lira sank back onto the floor, pulling the device out again. The spark had faded to a faint pulse, but it was still there, waiting. She ran her fingers over the screen, and the light flared once more, brighter than before. This time, she noticed something new—a ripple of color, a hint of gold weaving through the white. Her mind raced. Was this some old tech prototype? A relic from before Lumora’s tech boom? She thought of the rumors she’d heard—whispers of devices that could read thoughts, connect minds—but those were urban legends, weren’t they?


She needed answers. Slipping the device into her backpack, she crept downstairs, avoiding the creaky third step. Her room was a small sanctuary, cluttered with books and star charts Gran had given her. She locked the door, sat cross-legged on her bed, and pulled the device onto her lap. The spark pulsed again, and she focused, letting her thoughts drift to Gran’s stories—tales of a network of light, a weave of human souls. The screen shimmered, and the spark grew, tendrils of light stretching toward her hands like eager fingers.


“Okay,” she whispered, her voice trembling with excitement. “Show me something. Anything.” She thought of the stars again, of Gran’s voice saying, *The light is in you, Lira. Find it.* The device hummed louder, and the spark transformed—stretching, swirling—into a small, flickering flame. It danced on the screen, casting shadows on her walls, and for the first time in months, Lira felt a spark of her own ignite inside her.


She didn’t hear the knock at first. The flame held her, its warmth seeping into her bones. Then came a sharp rap, and Kai’s voice broke through. “Lira, you in there? Open up!”


Kai was her only real friend, a wiry boy with a mop of black hair and a knack for hacking Lumora’s digital feeds. She scrambled to her feet, shoving the device under her pillow, and unlocked the door. He stood there, grinning, a battered tablet tucked under his arm.


“Been calling you,” he said, stepping inside. “You zoned out or what?”


“I… found something,” she admitted, hesitating. She trusted Kai, but this felt too strange to share. Still, his curiosity mirrored her own, and she pulled the device out, showing him the faint pulse of light.


His eyes widened. “Whoa. Where’d you get that? Looks like an old Lumen—pre-2030 model, maybe. They were supposed to connect people’s thoughts or something, but the project got scrapped. Urban legend stuff.”


“Lumen?” Lira echoed, her heart racing. “What do you mean, connect thoughts?”


Kai leaned closer, examining the screen. “Rumors say Lumens tapped into your emotions, linked you to a network of other users. But the tech was unstable—too many people’s flames burned out from the noise. My dad worked on it before he switched to drones. He said they were dangerous.”


“Dangerous how?” Lira asked, her fingers tightening around the device. The flame flickered, as if sensing her unease.


“Overload, mostly. Too much input—anger, lies, chaos—could dim your light for good. Or worse.” Kai shrugged, but his tone was serious. “If this is real, you should be careful. Where’d you find it?”


“Gran’s attic,” she said softly. “It… it lights up when I think about her stories.”


Kai raised an eyebrow. “That’s wild. Let me run a scan—see if it’s still active.” He pulled out his tablet, connecting it to the Lumen with a thin cable. The screen lit up with code, scrolling too fast for Lira to follow. Then it stopped, and a single word flashed: *ACTIVE*.


“Active?” Lira whispered. “What does that mean?”


“It means it’s online,” Kai said, his voice low. “And if it’s part of the old network… someone out there might know you’ve got it.”


A chill ran through her. The flame pulsed again, brighter, and for a moment, she thought she heard a whisper—not Gran’s, but something else, distant and urgent. She clutched the Lumen tighter, her mind spinning. Was this a gift from Gran, or a door to something she wasn’t ready to face?


“Keep it hidden,” Kai warned, unplugging his tablet. “If the wrong people find out, they’ll want it. And if it’s still linked… well, let’s just say Lumora’s got enough noise without this waking up.”


Lira nodded, her thoughts a tangle of fear and wonder. She tucked the Lumen under her pillow again, its warmth a quiet promise against the cold uncertainty of the night. Outside, the city’s lights flickered, and somewhere, a star burned a little brighter—or so she hoped.
